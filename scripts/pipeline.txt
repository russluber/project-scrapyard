Order in which to run the scripts:
1. fetch_event_cards
2. parse_event_cards
3. fetch_fight_pages_sequential -> fetch_fight_pages (renamed)
4. parse_fight_pages
5. join_event_metadata_v2 -> join_event_metadata (renamed)
6. data_cleaning
7. eda.rmd


Patchwork done to fix fight_data_raw_enriched
- one_of_fetch_event_cards
- diagnostic
- backfill_event_map


Separate thing for doing networked (instead of cached) fighters static (height, weight, reach, dob) and dynamic (W/L record, etc.) metadata
- data_scraping_fighters_metadata3.R -> scrape_fighters_metadata
